#  EMPLOYEE INSIGHTS EXPLORER

## Overview:
The "Employee Insights Explorer" project involves analyzing a dataset of employees from ABC Company to gain valuable insights. The dataset contains information about various attributes such as name, team, position, age, height, weight, college, salary, and age group.

### Dataset Information:
- Columns: Name, Team, Number, Position, Age, Height, Weight, College, Salary, Age Group
- Total Rows: 458

## Questions Explored:
1) Team Distribution: Identify the number of employees in each team and provide the percentage split with respect to the total number of employees.
2) Position Segregation: Segregate the employees based on different positions within the company.
3) Age Group Analysis: Determine the predominant age group among employees.
4) High Spending Teams and Positions: Identify the teams and positions with high salary spending.
5) Correlation Analysis: Investigate the correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.

### Data Preprocessing:
Correct the 'Height' column by replacing incorrect data with random numbers between 150 and 180.

### Implementation:
Before addressing the specific questions, perform data preprocessing to ensure data quality. Then, explore the dataset using various exploratory data analysis techniques.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves visually and statistically analyzing datasets to find patterns, trends, and insights. It helps in detecting anomalies, developing recommendations for further investigation, and gaining a thorough understanding of the data.

1) Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data and correct anomalies.
2) Team Analysis: Determine team distribution and visualize it using countplot.
3) Position Segregation: Analyze position distribution and visualize it using countplot.
4) Age Group Identification: Identify the predominant age group and visualize its distribution.
5) Salary Analysis: Investigate salary distribution and visualize it using scatterplot.
6) Correlation Analysis: Explore the correlation between age and salary and visualize it using a heatmap.

## Conclusion:
The Python-based exploratory data analysis of the employee dataset has provided valuable insights into various aspects of the dataset. Through correlation analysis, outlier detection, and visualization, we gained a comprehensive understanding of employee attributes and their relationships. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Python tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy in visualizing and analyzing complex datasets. These insights lay the groundwork for further analysis and modeling.
